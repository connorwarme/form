# form  
  
Practice form validation  
- utilize constraint validation API  
- simple (email, country, zip code, password, password confirmation)  
- make sure all validation happens via JS (for sake of the exercise)  
  
Improvements:  
- learn how to evaluate forms AFTER user pauses for extended period or moves to another input field  
- design more user friendly "strong password" checklist that updates as user fills in password field  
- level up design / color palette, etc.
